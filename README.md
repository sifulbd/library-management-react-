# Minimal Library Management System

A minimal, client-side **Library Management System** built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **RTK Query (Redux Toolkit Query)** and **Tailwind CSS** (or plain CSS).  
This project demonstrates clean state management, a simple REST API integration, and a responsive minimalist UI to view/manage books and handle borrowing â€” **no authentication** required.

## Project Overview

Build a lightweight library system where users can:

-   View a list of books (table)
-   Add, edit, and delete books
-   Borrow books (manage copies and availability)
-   View a borrow summary (aggregated totals per book)
